## Preinstalled plugins

A bunch of [plugins](plugins.txt) are installed during the image build. Once they increase the image size considerably, the [Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org) version of the Jenkins Docker image is used as the base image ([jenkins/jenkins:lts-alpine](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/blob/master/Dockerfile-alpine)), in order to keep the built image as small as possible.

Most of the plugins enable other features, as described below.

## Default administrator

The default Jenkins administrator account is created during the execution of [default-user.groovy](scripts/default-user.groovy). Its credentials are obtained from the environment variables:

- JENKINS_USER (default: admin)
- JENKINS_PASS (default: jenkins)

## No setup wizard

With preinstalled plugins and a default administrator, there is no need of following the Jenkins wizard during its setup. For this reason, the wizard is disabled: `-Djenkins.install.runSetupWizard=false`.

## Default location configuration

The default Jenkins location is configured during the execution of [config-location.groovy](scripts/config-location.groovy). The Jenkins URL and the e-mail address Jenkins use as the sender for e-mail notification are obtained from the environment variables:

- JENKINS_URL (default: <http://localhost:8080>)
- JENKINS_EMAIL (default: jenkins@example.com)

## Default Maven installation

The default [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org) installation is configured during the execution of [config-maven.groovy](scripts/config-maven.groovy). The Maven version is obtained from the environment variable:

- MAVEN_VERSION (default: 3.6.3)

Maven can then be referenced by `M3` in the Jenkinsfile, like in the example below:

```groovy
node {
    def mvnHome = tool 'M3'
    ...
    stage('Build and Unit Tests') {
        sh "'${mvnHome}/bin/mvn' clean install"
    }
    ...
}
```

## Capability of running Ansible playbooks

The default [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) installation is configured during the execution of [config-ansible.groovy](scripts/config-ansible.groovy). Ansible can then be referenced by `Ansible` in the Jenkinsfile, like in the example below:

```groovy
node {
    ...
    stage('Deploy to AWS') {
        withCredentials([[$class: 'AmazonWebServicesCredentialsBinding', credentialsId: 'aws', accessKeyVariable: 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', secretKeyVariable: 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']]) {
            ansiblePlaybook(installation: 'Ansible', playbook: 'deploy-to-aws.yml')
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

This feature is enabled by the [Ansible plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ansible).

## Docker in Docker

The myjenkins Docker image is prepared itself to enable the execution of Docker commands. So, you are able to run pipelines in the myjenkins Docker container that build Docker images, push Docker images to a Docker Registry or execute any other Docker command (example below). The only requirement is to [bind mount](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts) your host Docker daemon Unix socket to the container Docker daemon Unix socket: `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`.

```groovy
node {
    def appDockerImage
    ...
    stage('Build Docker Image') {
        appDockerImage = docker.build("esignbr/logistics")
    }
    stage('Deploy Docker Image') {
        docker.withRegistry("", "dockerhub") {
            appDockerImage.push()
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

## Adding a global credentials

[A new global credentials can be created in Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/#adding-new-global-credentials) with the execution of [add-credentials.groovy](scripts/add-credentials.groovy). It only happens if the following environment variables are defined:

- CREDENTIALS_ID
- CREDENTIALS_USER
- CREDENTIALS_PASS

The global credentials can then be referenced by its `credentialsId` in the Jenkinsfile, like in the example below:

```groovy
node {
    ...
    stage('Deploy Java Artifacts') {
        withCredentials([[$class: 'UsernamePasswordMultiBinding', credentialsId: 'ossrh', usernameVariable: 'OSSRH_USER', passwordVariable: 'OSSRH_PASSWORD']]) {
            sh "'${mvnHome}/bin/mvn' -s .travis.settings.xml source:jar deploy -DskipTests=true"
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

## Adding an AWS credentials

A new AWS credentials can be created in Jenkins with the execution of [add-aws-credentials.groovy](scripts/add-credentials.groovy). It only happens if the following environment variables are defined:

- AWS_CREDENTIALS_ID
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

The AWS credentials can then be referenced by its `credentialsId` in the Jenkinsfile, like in the example below:

```groovy
node {
    ...
    stage('Deploy to AWS') {
        withCredentials([[$class: 'AmazonWebServicesCredentialsBinding', credentialsId: 'aws', accessKeyVariable: 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', secretKeyVariable: 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']]) {
            ansiblePlaybook(installation: 'Ansible', playbook: 'deploy-to-aws.yml')
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

This feature is enabled by the [CloudBees AWS Credentials plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/aws-credentials).

## In-process Script Approval

[An in-process script or a method signature can be approved in Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/script-approval) with the execution of [approve-signature.groovy](scripts/approve-signature.groovy). It only happens if the following environment variable is defined:

- SIGNATURE

## Integration with Bitbucket

Jenkins can be integrated to [Bitbucket](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket) with the execution of [config-bitbucket.groovy](scripts/config-bitbucket.groovy). It only happens if the following environment variables are defined:

- BITBUCKET_URL - the endpoint where your Bitbucket instance is available
- BITBUCKET_CREDENTIALS_ID - the global credentials id previously added to Jenkins with the Bitbucket *username* and *password*

This feature is enabled by the [Bitbucket Branch Source plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cloudbees-bitbucket-branch-source).

## Integration with SonarQube

Jenkins can be integrated to [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org) with the execution of [config-sonarqube.groovy](scripts/config-sonarqube.groovy). It only happens if the following environment variable is defined:

- SONARQUBE_URL - the endpoint where your SonarQube instance is available

:warning: If you have disabled anonymous access in SonarQube and have generated an user token for performing the static code analysis, set the environment variable SONARQUBE_TOKEN.

SonarQube can then be referenced by `SonarQube` in the Jenkinsfile, like in the example below:

```groovy
node {
    ...
    stage('Static Code Analysis') {
        withSonarQubeEnv('SonarQube') {
            sh "'${mvnHome}/bin/mvn' sonar:sonar"
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

:information_source: You don't need to pass the *installationName* parameter to **withSonarQubeEnv** if just one SonarQube server was configured in Jenkins. More details in [Using a Jenkins pipeline](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-jenkins/#header-5).

This feature is enabled by the [SonarQube plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sonar).

## Integration with Slack

Jenkins can be integrated to [Slack](https://slack.com) with the execution of [config-slack.groovy](scripts/config-slack.groovy). It only happens if the following environment variables are defined:

- SLACK_WORKSPACE
- SLACK_TOKEN

Slack can then be used in the Jenkinsfile, like in the example below:

```groovy
node {
    ...
    stage('Results') {
        ...
        slackSend(channel: 'builds', message: 'Pipeline succeed!', color: 'good')
    }
}
```

This feature is enabled by the [Slack Notification plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/slack).

## JVM Metrics

The Jenkins JVM metrics are exposed by [jmx_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter), a process for exposing JMX Beans via HTTP for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) consumption. The JVM metrics are exposed through port **8081**, as passed to the Java Agent:

`-javaagent:/usr/bin/jmx_exporter/jmx_prometheus_javaagent.jar=8081:/usr/bin/jmx_exporter/config.yaml`

## UI tests capability

The Jenkins image has installed [Firefox ESR](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations) and [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver) (available in `/usr/local/bin/geckodriver`), enabling that way UI tests with [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org).

The example below shows how the UI test can be performed during the execution of your Jenkinsfile:

```groovy
node {
    ...
    stage('UI Tests') {
        sh "'${mvnHome}/bin/mvn' -f test-selenium test -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=/usr/local/bin/geckodriver -Dheadless=true"
    }
    ...
}
```

## Jenkins hardening

The Jenkins security is improved during the execution of [harden-jenkins.groovy](scripts/harden-jenkins.groovy) and [default-project-authorization.groovy](scripts/default-project-authorization.groovy), when the following actions are taken:

- [Enabling CSRF protection](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/CSRF+Protection);
- [Enabling Agent -> Master access control](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Slave+To+Master+Access+Control);
- Disabling the deprecated [JNLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Web_Start#Java_Network_Launching_Protocol_(JNLP));
- Preventing builds run as SYSTEM by configuring [access control for builds](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/security/build-authorization).
